TSDocs.dev is a service that lets you browse type reference documentation
for Javascript packages.

It works even with packages that aren't written in Typescript (sourced from DefinetlyTyped)
or when packages re-export types from other packages.

## Development

1. Ensure that you have redis running locally
2. Run `yarn install`
3. Run `yarn dev`
